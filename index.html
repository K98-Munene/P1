    <div class="profile-text">
      I am a God-fearing, self-driven, and dependable professional with a background in accounting and cashiering,
      complemented by a Diploma in Information Technology. I have hands-on experience in managing financial records,
      handling transactions accurately, and supporting IT-related functions, including CCTV installation and maintenance.
      My adaptability enables me to perform effectively in fast-paced environments, handle multiple responsibilities,
      and meet deadlines under pressure. I am a quick learner, a strong team player, and passionate about leveraging both
      finance and technology skills to contribute to organizational success. I also have a keen interest in research and
